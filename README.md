#Election Analysis with Python

## Overview of Project	

   We are using python in VS code to analyze the election results. The election results dataset is in a csv file. It has information including the Ballot ID, County names and candidate names We import the csv file to the VS code to do the analysis. In this project, we use for loop, list and dictionary (commands) to find out the totals (votes) for the election, each county and each candidate. Also, the winner candidate.

Results

Here is the election results:

![2018 runtime]( https://github.com/jkmom/Election_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Election_results.png)

•	The total votes of this election results are 369,711.
•	The County with most votes is Denver (306,055 votes)
-	The vote percentage in Denver in the whole election is 82.8%. We can tell the people is Denver is a lot actively involved in the election in comparison to another two states. Maybe Jefferson and Aprapahoe need to encourage their citizen to get involved in the election more.
•	The winner is Diana DeGette (272,892 votes):
-	The winning percentage is 73.8%. It is considered high rate in this election and leave other competitors far behind.

Election Audit Summary

   We have three states and three candidates in our database and running the codes for this dataset is only taking less than a couple of seconds. I can see if we are running a bigger database, it might only take a couple of minutes to complete the analysis.
   We are getting our results one by one through each row. Maybe we can try to look at three rows at the same time and using less loops. So, we don’t need to use three to five loops.
   Also, we may try to suggest adding the population in the dataset and then add new calculation in the loop. In this way, we may see the population vs vote rate and see why some counties have low vote rates.
